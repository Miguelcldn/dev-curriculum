bio: "Programming since the age of 12, at which age made my first program in BASIC 
        and then my first calculator the same year. Since then I learnt and used C++ and C# 
        until I entered to University always aiming to take my passion further away. In love with 
        videogames, as a gamer and as a developer, wishing to work in that area while creating my 
        own small games for practices and fun, but I've worked in several projects that 
        helped me to dominate a whole lot of technologies and techniques that makes me a self-sufficient 
        developer."
